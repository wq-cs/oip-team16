## Technical Requirements

- Static website (no dynamic content generation)
- Built with Next.js for optimal performance

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/wq-cs/oip-team16.git
cd oip-team16
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**
```bash

```

4. **Open your browser**
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application

## Available Scripts
